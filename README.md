1/ when you choose admin option from our first page 
 
you have to enter those informations  in the login admin page  to have access to admin dashboard .
Admin Dashboard :  Mail :firaskasraoui@gmail.com
                                password: SAMARITAN7XP33h






if you want to use  the Dashboard you have  to download the folders  from the master branch not the main one (due to technical issues )  of course make it the default . 
Once it’s download it   you have to copy the folders admin and config  from tp_php-master and paste it in tp_php-main 
then i guess it’s gonna to be easy …. enjoy the admin experience  

you can see  both users and admins delete them , edit them , and add new ones  if you want , you can also see the feedback which they are sorted   ,  complaints first then suggestions .  the log out .   

about the code:  the first page is index.php the admin dashboard is organized in 2 folders admin and config .

2/ if you choose user option from our first page:
*/for the first time using the website you must sign up 
otherwise,you just enter you login info .

you will find yourself in start.php and enjoy the experience.
